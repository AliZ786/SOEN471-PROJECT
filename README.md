# SOEN471-PROJECT - Suicide and Depression Sentiment Analysis

## Abstract

**Please note that we were intially supposed to do Promly project, but due to their unprofessional behavior, we decide to opt on doing our own project.**

Social media has become a very powerful tool in our everyday lives. It helps us build new connections, allows us to network ourselves better, and also enjoy banter with other people around the world. However, not all social media is beneficial to us. Many people online are subject to cyberbullying, death threats, and even hacking attempts. This leads to an increased chance of a person being depressed and even sometimes going to the extreme of wanting to kill themselves. Our project wants to be able to prevent this as we want to implement a sentiment analysis project, where through various text messages, we will predict if that person is suicidal or not. 


# 1. Objectives

For our project, we want to answer the following research questions:

1. Will our project be able to receive an accuracy measure of atleast 90%, as we want to classify the most amounts of messages properly?
2. What are the keywords from a corpus which would lead to a message being clasified as suicidal/non-sucidal?
